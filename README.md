This file will store all the keystrokes you have made previously.

### Let's do a Evil thing using _**BufferX**_

Think of a situation when you need to get all the received keystrokes by a user from a Windows system everytime the system runs. You can do this by using _**BufferX**_. All you have to do is:-

- Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32` and create a folder named `Records`. You can also create this `Records` wherever you want , but make sure it can't be found easily.
- Put the `BufferX.exe` file in the `Records` folder.
- Create a shortcut of `BufferX.exe`.
- Press `Win+R` , type `shell:startup` and hit `Enter`.
- Paste the shortcut inside the newly opened file explorer window.

This will run _**BufferX**_ everytime the system starts.

### Install _**BufferX**_ once in a system and have fun.
